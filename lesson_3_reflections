When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are working on differnt computers. When more than one person is working on a project. As a backup.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 	just like with commits you only want to update the remote repository when you are ready to do so, and with the branches that you want to have there
